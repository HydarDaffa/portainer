Is the docker daemon running?

This error typically occurs when:
1. Docker daemon is not running
2. User doesn't have permission to access the Docker socket
3. Docker socket path is incorrect
4. Docker service has crashed

To resolve this issue:
1. Start the Docker daemon: sudo systemctl start docker
2. Add user to docker group: sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
3. Verify Docker is running: docker ps
4. Check Docker socket permissions: ls -la /var/run/docker.sock`,
